There are two kinds of types in C#: value types and reference types. 

Variables of value types directly contain their data

Reference types are objects

With reference types, it is possible for two variables to reference the same object and thus possible for operations on one variable to affect the object referenced by the other variable. 

Character and string processing in C# uses Unicode encoding. The char type represents a UTF-16 code unit, and the string type represents a sequence of UTF-16 code units.
